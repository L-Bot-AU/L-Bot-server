# UI stuff to change
- "Normal Opening Hours" instead of "Opening Hours" (maybe?)
- center "TODAY"
- Move "How to use the website to some plce obscure"
- Add tab for past trends
- progress bar case bashing
- more css to file for each tab
- librarian email address in about page

```"probably most important thing (imo) is that everything looks wayy too big (titles/headings are huge, the bar is huge)
and also the alert bar is janky, the about page isn't centered very well and the events in the events page are a bit too sall
everything just feels too overwhelming because of how big it is
the alert has a bit too much padding and covers the entire horizontal part of the screen
so is the usage bar
the text also is pretty big. I get your argument about less readability, but this is excessive
nah the screen design leaves some whitespace on the sides
everything's a lot more compact on the screen design"```
